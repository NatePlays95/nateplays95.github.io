I'm an energetic boy who loves to make games! I'm always finding ways to blend my love for tech with my artistic side. And that's what this website is all about: sharing my creative journey with you! 

I'm currently an undergraduate student in Computer Science based in Cear√°, Brazil.

On this website, you can find some of the games I have made, as well as some prototypes and experiments. I hope you enjoy playing them and learning more about my process. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions, comments, or suggestions.
