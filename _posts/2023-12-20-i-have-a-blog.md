I'm not much of a writer, nor do I use social media that much, but I still felt I needed some place to just write on what was going on in my life that week or month.
It certainly beats sending screenshots of cool stuff I made to 5, 10 people at a time. 
Affirmation is great and all, but "Like and Retweet" numbers stress me out, so an alternative platform would be great.

That's why I made this blog.

While updates will be pretty frequent at the start as I put all my backlog of news and events here in text form, and update my projects portfolio, expect the posts to slow down a far bit. I fully expect to forget this blog even exists for a few months at a time, but hey, as long as I'm living my life instead of chasing numbers, it should be OK.

As of the time of writing this, I want to write on a few jam games I've made, as well as some other hobbies. Having a blog made with Jekyll makes it simple enough, so I hope I get the hang of it quick. See you there!
