## About the Project

Project Nitro is a prototype I made for Erlend of Spicy Lobster games for six months. 
I also had <a href="https://www.artstation.com/paulohncostaart">PauloHNCosta</a> help with all the 3D models for environments as well as models, rigs and animations
for the drivers and their bikes.

#### Features

- Kart-style arcade driving physics
- Cute, retro artstyle with options for driver and bike
- 4 different items found in item boxes
- AI drivers that follow the road and use items

## Development Tools

The prototype was made in Godot, powered by the Godot-Jolt plugin. Paulo uses Blender for modelling game assets.

## Project Details

Drifty was made as a prototype or proof of concept of how a game featuring Fish Folk's titular characters could look and play like.

You can read more about my experience working in Fish Folk - Drifty <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/blog/2024/working-on-fishfolk-drifty/">in this blog post</a>.

#### Future Plans

Paulo and I have already received our money for working on the project, and it's now up to Erlend to study if and how this should be made into
a real game or not, if it needs a Kickstarter for extra funding or if it can survive out of contributions. He's also showing it off in a few events
so that could bring extra eyes to my work as well.

As for myself, I had the opportunity to research AI drivers before having studied formal artificial intelligence agents in university, and
that R&D resulted in a decent set of scripts I can reuse for another racing game project. It's nowhere near framework completeness but I'm getting there.
