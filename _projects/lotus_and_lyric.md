## About the Project

Lotus and Lyric is a strategy role-playing game I made in my free time between 2022 and 2023. It was made as a 30 minute long vertical slice to gather feedback to possibly make it into a longer game, as well as study the viability of making such game by myself.

### Features

- Tactics RPG gameplay inspired by old classics
- Three short chapters, each with its own combat stage
- Unique characters and visuals

## Development Tools

The game was made in RPGMaker MV, with some helper plugins.
In particular, Ryan Bram's SRPG Converter for MV is the bone of the battle system, with heavy modifications.

Character key art and pixel sprites were done by me, using Krita and Photoshop.
Tilesets and music were outsourced for free.

<!-- ## Project Details

Here, you can go into more depth about your game development project. Talk about the inspiration behind the game, challenges faced during development, and any interesting anecdotes or stories related to the project. 

#### Development Process

Describe the step-by-step process you followed during development. This could include brainstorming, prototyping, coding, testing, and refining the game mechanics.

#### Challenges and Solutions

Discuss any challenges or obstacles you encountered and how you overcame them. This can provide insights into your problem-solving skills and the evolution of the project. -->

#### Future Plans

While I do have plenty of characters and an entire story written in this universe, MV has proven itself difficult to use to add and expand on content. Eventing cutscenes, tweaking user interface, creating new equipment and classes and enemies takes a good while. MV also made it difficult to debug in different machines and would make it very difficult to play anywhere not running Windows 10 or 11.

I will save the story and characters for a possibly better scoped project in the future.
