## About the Project

Workout Hero was made as a team assignment for a Software Engineering class with 5 other teammates.
I was mainly in charge of User Interface design and implementation, as well as routing scenes and writing
all the pre-production planning documents.

#### Features

- Hundreds of different exercises with animated illustrations;
- Per-user exercise routine creation saved on the cloud; 
- Server-side statistics tracker for reps, spent calories and other stats;
- Attractive and smooth user interface.

## Development Tools

The app was made using a React Native frontend and built with Expo, and the backend uses PostgreSQL.
We tested builds on our Android phones and in the Android Studio SDK.

## Project Details

#### Motivation
- Workers and students in tech jobs are more prone to sedentary lifestyles;
- The fitness environments can be daunting to newcomers;
- People struggle to follow their routines from lack of motivation.

#### Goals
- Make a noob-friendly interface that welcomes and empowers users;
- Using gamification to increase engagement and motivation.
