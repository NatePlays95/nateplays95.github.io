I fully expect to forget this blog even exists for a few months at a time, but hey, as long as I’m living my life instead of chasing numbers, it should be OK.</p> <p>As of the time of writing this, I want to write on a few jam games I’ve made, as well as some other hobbies. Having a blog made with Jekyll makes it simple enough, so I hope I get the hang of it quick. See you there!</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="personal"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m not much of a writer, nor do I use social media that much, but I still felt I needed some place to just write on what was going on in my life that week or month.
